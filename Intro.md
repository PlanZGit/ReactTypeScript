# Intro

Think of the initial investment in the long run when using typescipt.

## Why ?

With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime

Provides a way to describe the shape of an objecthance providing better documentation and autocomplete

Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier

## Issues

TypeScipt is just frustrating most of the times.

I have to write a lot more code than I normally do and the complier keeps complaining. I simpoly don't know what to do about those errors

It doesn't seem to be productive for me
